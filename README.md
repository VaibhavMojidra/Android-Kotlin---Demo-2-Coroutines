# Android Kotlin Demo 2 Coroutines

Kotlin Coroutines are a feature of the Kotlin programming language that allows for easy and efficient asynchronous programming. Coroutines provide a way to write asynchronous code in a synchronous style, making it easier to read and understand.

In general, coroutines are lightweight threads that can be suspended and resumed at any time, allowing for non-blocking, concurrent programming. This makes it possible to write asynchronous code that is much easier to read and maintain than traditional callback-based code.

In Kotlin, coroutines are created using the suspend keyword, which marks a function as a coroutine. Coroutines can then be launched using a CoroutineScope, which provides a way to manage and cancel coroutines.

Kotlin provides several built-in functions and utilities for working with coroutines, including async, launch, and runBlocking. async allows you to launch a coroutine and get a Deferred result, which can be used to retrieve the result of the coroutine once it completes. launch allows you to launch a coroutine without waiting for a result, and runBlocking allows you to launch a coroutine from a non-coroutine context.
